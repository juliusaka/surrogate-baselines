# surrogate-baselines

## Description
This repository contains implementations and interfacing scripts to various surrogate modeling methods such that they can be used with the data conventions as defined in the "bnode-core" repository. 

## Installation
uv is used to manage the virtual environment.
Run
```
uv sync
```
to install a virtual environment of the project defined in pyproject.toml. You can also use ```uv sync``` to test if the package can be installed in the way you specified it.

```
[linux-bash]
source .venv/bin/activate
[windows-powershell]
.venv\Scripts\Activate

```
Instead of using the venv, you can just place ```uv run``` in front of the file you want to run.
